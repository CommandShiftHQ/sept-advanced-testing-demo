# Advanced Testing 
Demo to show how to use mocks, stubs and spies to write unit tests in Express using Sinon.
There are 2 test files which test the controllers hello and user. If the app is started the user controller will not work as it hasn't been connected up to a router and the app.js - feel free to try to get it working

Also shows how to use git actions to automatically run tests if someone tries to push code to main branch or merge to main branch.
